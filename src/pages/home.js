                        <p>"It's scary to change careers. I only gained confidence that I
                            could code by working through the hundreds of hours of free lessons
                            on freeCodeCamp. Within a year I had a six-figure job as a Software
                            Engineer. freeCodeCamp changed my life."</p>

                        <p>"freeCodeCamp was the gateway to my career as a software developer. 
                            The well-structured curriculum took my coding knowledge from a total 
                            beginner level to a very confident level. It was everything I needed
